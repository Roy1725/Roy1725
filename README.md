## ðŸš€ Project Overview

### Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

This project involves creating a system that monitors temperature and humidity levels using sensors connected to a microcontroller and sends the data to a server for processing and visualization.

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 programmed in C++
- **Sensors**: DHT22 for temperature and humidity
- **Communication Protocol**: MQTT to send data to a Raspberry Pi
- **Data Processing**: Python script on the Raspberry Pi to process and store data
- **Web Dashboard**: HTML/CSS for front-end, Flask (Python) for back-end to display data in real-time

### Rainwater Detector


A rainwater detector designed to measure and detect the presence of rain. It uses a conductive sensing pad and a microcontroller to process signals and trigger actions such as stopping irrigation or logging rainfall data.

- **Components**: Sensing pad, microcontroller, output interface
- **Applications**: Irrigation systems, weather monitoring, smart homes

### Line-Following Robot

An autonomous robot built to follow a predefined path marked by a line. It uses infrared sensors and a microcontroller to process data and control the motors, ensuring the robot stays on track.

- **Components**: Chassis, infrared sensors, microcontroller, motor drivers, power supply
- **Applications**: Educational projects, robotics competitions, industrial automation

### Web Development (HTML/CSS)
- **[Portfolio Website](https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website)**: A personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript to enhance my web development skills
- Advanced Python for data science and machine learning
